<h3><a id="faq">Volunteer FAQ</a></h3>

<h5>When is the nursery open for volunteering?</h5>
<p>
We are open every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday from 10a - 1p. Please check our Facebook page for any updates.
</p>

<h5>Do I need to sign up to volunteer for nursery or garden days?</h5>
<p> Please email to let us know if you'll be coming and it's your first time. Afterwards you can drop in whenever without RSVPing.
</p>

<h5>
Drop-in volunteer hours are 10a - 1p. Does this mean I have to stay the whole time?
</h5>
<p>
Not at all! You make your own hours. This is just the time that the nursery is open.
</p>

<h5>
What do I wear?
</h5>
<p>
Anything that you don't mind getting a little dirty and/or wet. Closed-toed shoes are also recommended. Face masks are optional but welcome.
</p>

<h5>
What should I bring?
</h5>
<p>
Bring a water bottle and sun protection.
</p>

<h5>
Do you work rain or shine?
</h5>
<p>
Yes! But on rainy days, nursery volunteers work in the hoop house so rain gear is not required. Garden days are usually scheduled on sunny days.
</p>

<h5>
Do I have to be a CNPS member?
</h5>
<p>
No, everyone is welcome at the nursery!
</p>

<h5>
Where do I park?
</h5>
<p>
See our <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a> page for parking instructions.
</p>

<h5>
Can I bring my kids with me?
</h5>
<p>
Yes! But if your child is under 18, they will need to accompanied by an adult.
</p>

<h5>
Do I get a discount on plants or merchandise?
</h5>
<p>
Unforunately, not at this time. But volunteers often do get to take home native plant seedlings.
</p>
