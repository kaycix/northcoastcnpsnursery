    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div>
        <b>I'm interested! How do I sign up?</b>
        <p>
            Check back here on September 1st! You will be able to sign up for a shopping slot on Saturday. Sunday will be a regular shopping day - no sign ups necessary. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>I might want to shop for longer than 30-minutes. Should I reserve multiple time slots?</b>
        <p>
        No need to! Just sign up for one time slot and extend your visit as needed.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>What payment methods are accepted?</b>
        <p>
            Cash and check are always üëç. However, we do also take credit - thank you!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display:none">
        <b>I'm having trouble signing up using Sign Up Genius.</b>
        <p>
        Send us an email with your name and preferred time slot. We will sign you up and send you an email confirmation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Why should I sign up to shop?</b>
        <p>
            Sign ups are only required on Saturday.  We recommend doing so if: 
            <br/>&#9702; You plan on showing up with a list! Some species are popular and we do run out.
            <br/>&#9702; You want to go but the extra motivation of signing up will help. (We've all been there üòâ)

    <h1>Thank You</h1>
    <div>
    <p>
    Thank you for being with us on this journey to spread native plants and protect biodiversity!
    </p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who shops our sales - from those of you rewilding entire yards to those of you tending a few native plants on your balcony. Your stories continue to motivate and inspire us.</p>
    <p>We appreciate the nurseries and vendors that we partner with and the community of sharing and support you offer us. We feel so lucky to be working alongside such passionate people.</p>
    <p>Thank you to nursery managers Chris and Barbara for your tireless efforts and countless hours of hard work. We couldn't ask for more dedicated leaders.</p>
    <p>Lastly, huge thank yous to all our nursery and garden volunteers. Whether you have volunteered for one hour or many more, we appreciate you! This has been a particularly long winter but seeing everyone show up, ready to work in the cold mornings warms our hearts.
