    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div>
        <b>Why do I need to sign up to shop on Saturday?</b>
        <p>
           Signing up will enable us to space out parking arrivals throughout our busiest day as we do have limited parking. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>I'm having trouble signing up with Sign Up Genius.</b>
        <p>
          Email us at <a href="mailto:northcoastcnps@gmail.com">northcoastcnps@gmail.com</a> with your preferred available time slots and we'll try to help! 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>I might want to shop for longer than 30-minutes. Should I reserve multiple time slots?</b>
        <p>
        No need to. Just sign up for one time slot and extend your visit as needed.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>What payment methods are accepted?</b>
        <p>
            Cash and check are always üëç. However, we do also take credit - thank you!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="display:none">
        <b>I'm having trouble signing up using Sign Up Genius.</b>
        <p>
        Send us an email with your name and preferred time slot. We will sign you up and send you an email confirmation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Why should I sign up to shop?</b>
        <p>
            Sign ups are only required on Saturday.  We recommend doing so if: 
            <br/>&#9702; You plan on showing up with a list! Some species are popular and we do run out.
            <br/>&#9702; You want to go but the extra motivation of signing up will help. (We've all been there üòâ) 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>Can I get an idea of pricing?</b>
        <p>
            Most plants come in either 4-inch containers or 1-gallon pots. The 4-inch containers are $5 and 1-gallon pots are $10 - $12, unless marked otherwise.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>How do I know what plants to get?</b>
        <p>
            Get to know your planting site! Do you have sun or mostly shade? Click through our lists into the Calscape links to find more information on each plant. There will also be advisors at the sale that will be happy to help answer specific questions you have.

    <h1>Thank You</h1>
    <div>
    <p>
    Thank you for sticking with us on this journey to spread native plants and protect biodiversity!
    </p>
    <p>Thank you to everyone who shops our sales - from those of you rewilding entire yards to those of you tending a few native plants on your balcony. Your stories fill us with so much hope and inspiration.</p>
    <p>We appreciate the nurseries and vendors that we partner with and the community of sharing and support you offer us. We feel so lucky to be working alongside such passionate people.</p>
    <p>Thank you to nursery managers Chris and Barbara for your tireless efforts and countless hours of hard work. Not only do we appreciate the 5 billion things you do to make this nursery tick, we appreciate that you are constantly training volunteers and helping to spread native plant knowledge into this community.</p> 
    <p>Lastly, huge thank yous to all our nursery and garden volunteers. Whether you have volunteered for one hour or many more, we appreciate you! We are well aware that we couldn't do any of this without the generosity of our volunteers who simply (and very importantly!) choose to show up for us.
