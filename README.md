North Coast CNPS Nursery

This is the website for the North Coast CNPS Nursery. To encourage people to visit the nursery, where they can learn about and purchase native plants - which are so important to restoring local ecosystems and build climate resilience. 

Purpose:
Out current North Coast CNPS website functions poorly, especially on mobile. It is largely frozen and difficult (impossible?) to get permissions to work on. 
A new official website is in the works - however this website may be needed to bridge the gap while we await the new website. 

Technical Behind-The-Scenes Notes:
This website uses a combination of GitHub Pages and the Minimal Mistakes theme. 
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that serves a website directly from the GitHub repository. 
Jekyll powers GitHub pages. 
Minimal Mistakes is the theme we're using to style this website. 

Notes:
Useful sed command for finding and replacing all 
sed -i -e 's#cnps_2023_05#HOLD#g' *
