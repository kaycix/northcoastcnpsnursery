description: 
    short : "It is likely that Trillium ovatum, commonly known as Wake Robin, is the most familiar floral sight
in our woods and forests as one of the earliest blooming of our native flowers and a herald of
spring. Members of the Lilaceae family, they are recognizable by the collar of whorled bright
green leaves (usually 3) held above a bare stem, holding a single bright white flower. The white
flower gradually turns to purple as it ages."
