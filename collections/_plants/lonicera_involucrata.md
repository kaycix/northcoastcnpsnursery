        - "Twinberry"  
    scientific: "Lonicera Involucrata" 
 
category: "shrub"

description: 
    short: "Such a unique and beautiful shrub - aptly named for its paired flowers and resulting berries. Yes, the berries are toxic but they don't present a danger to children because they taste truly terrible (don't ask us how we know this). We find ours to be quite the hummingbird magnet."
    location: "Loves moist soil and full to partial shade."
