We're having a little fun with science today. These are 2 batches of Checkerbloom seedlings pulled out of the demonstration garden on our last Garden Work Day.

They were identical at the start - but one batch stayed outside and the other sat indoors on a window sill. Check out the 3-4X growth difference we captured in just 3.5 weeks! ðŸ˜®

We've all heard that in the Winter, plants go to "sleep". But what does that mean?
It's called "dormancy". Cold temperatures slow down plant metabolism and growth as a protective measure - new leaves and flowers are extra vulnerable to frost damage. 
Lower temperatures are necessary to stimulate specific growth hormones, so it's not a bad thing. But the sustained cold temperatures we've experienced have made this winter an especially interesting one for all of us plant lovers.

Send these plants some warm thoughts! These specific plants will get bigger eventually and will be sent home with Volunteers to show our Thanks.
