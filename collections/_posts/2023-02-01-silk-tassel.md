Time to Talk about our Plant of the Month! This specific one has a lovely Cinderella story attached.
</p>
<p>
This is a Coast Silk Tassel (garrya elliptica). Isn't it STUNNING?
But it's not just any Coast Silk Tassel. 
This photo was taken at the Arcata Community Center Native Plant Garden, stewarded by the wonderful Pete Haggard.

This garden is a little slice of heaven located beside the Arcata Community Center / Health Sport.  But it began as a construction fill site destined for a life of oblivion. 
</p>
<p>
Lovingly adopted and tended, hundreds of native plants and bees now make their home in this little unassuming plot of land. 
It's a beaming example of how native plants and wildlife can coexist in urban settings. Wouldn't you love a city with more of THIS??

It was adopted through the powerful but little-known Adopt A Park program through the City of Arcata: https://www.cityofarcata.org/424/Adopt-A-Park

Are you a fan of Pete's work? We are too! We also love his book:

And you can search YouTube for his talks. (Although I'm having trouble locating his latest CNPS Fall 2022 one - anyone?)
