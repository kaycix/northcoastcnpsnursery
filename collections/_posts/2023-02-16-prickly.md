Canyon Gooseberry (Ribes menziesii) in the demonstration garden today.

This super prickly shrub is your native plant equivalent of a “Keep Out” sign 😂
We keep ours in a corner of the garden and admire it from a safe distance! Attractive to pollinators and hummingbirds - deer resistant and great for a thorny hedge if you need that sort of thing.
