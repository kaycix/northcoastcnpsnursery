Time for our March Plant of the Month!
</p>
<p>
We're starting to see little beacons of Spring, like in this Red Flowering Currant (Ribes sanguineum). 
Keep an eye out for this beautiful shrub when you're out and about. The showy pink flowers really stand out this time of year ... especially THIS year while everything else is still lying dormant in the c-c-cold.
