This sweet little native lawn was spotted at a private residence in Arcata.
Itâ€™s not quite what you thought a native lawn replacement would look like, right?

Itâ€™s perfect for those who want to hold onto their lawn but also want to live by their values of being in balance with nature. Wouldnâ€™t you love to see lawns, public areas, and golf courses do the same?

Feeling inspired? Here's a little more detail.
</p>
<p>
This Yarrow Mix Lawn was planted via hydro seeding method in Spring 2023 by Miller Farms Nursery.
</p>
This particular native mix was designed and specified by Jessica Hall, of Wildling Design Studio.
Jessica specializes in native plantings and she designed the entire site planting with local native species.
<p>
Hereâ€™s her recipe:
Common Yarrow, California Brome-Grass, California Oatgrass, Coastal Larkspur, Red Fescue, Beach Strawberry, Sky Lupine, Checkerbloom
</p>
<p>Planting native doesnâ€™t mean giving up entirely on the things weâ€™re used to.
But it does require us to break decades-old patterns. And tbh itâ€™s kind of a win-win: Native plants support biodiversity, while often being more low-maintenance ðŸ¥°
</p>
Thank you to everyone trying to do better for our planet. Every little bit counts.
